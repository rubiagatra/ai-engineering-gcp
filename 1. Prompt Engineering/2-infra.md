Provide the gcloud commands to:

Create a new Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL instance (db-f1-micro tier) named 'my-prod-db' in the 'asia-southeast2â€™' region.
Set the root password to a secure, randomly generated string (show how to handle this, perhaps by suggesting an environment variable).
Configure the instance to allow public IP connections (for development purposes only, with a note about security implications).

Ensure the commands are idempotent where possible or provide guidance on checking for existing resources.
